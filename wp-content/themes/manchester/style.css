Description: The saying goes that cleanliness is next to godliness. Unfortunately, searching the web for a new home can be a dirty (and, occasionally, hellish) business. Why not help your users clean up the mess with a tidy real estate website? Manchester’s bright, simple feel, neat borders, and red and blue accents will give your cleaning lady a run for her money and your visitors a zenlike user experience. Perfect for both individual agents and single-office agencies, Manchester is ideal for displaying and surfing multiple property listings, with neat borders, a two-column layout, and top-level page navigation. It’s also fully customizable, so you can make it your own, and SEO optimized, which means more chances to show off your properties. If only it were that easy to get the pet stains out of your carpet… Use with <a href="https://placester.com/">Placester</a>'s <a href="wordpress.org/extend/plugins/placester/">Real Estate Builder plugin</a>.
