== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Preserve IDs options can be used? =
Among many different migration options Cart2Cart allows to: preserve product IDs on the Target Store, preserve order IDs on the Target Store, preserve customer IDs on the Target Store.
These options are available for different shopping carts. You may check the supported carts page to ensure that you can migrate such data.
Please note, there are cases when IDs preservation has limitations:
you can use preservation of IDs only if you choose "Delete current data from the Target Store before the migration" option; you can't use preservation if you use "Recent Data Migration".

= What is the option of Preserving order IDs on Target store? =
Preserve Order IDs is an optional feature that allows you to match your source store order ID with the one on the target store. You can choose the option on the step of Migration Setup - Entities Selection.
The order IDs will be migrated to the target store without changes, for example: source store order #19 will be migrated as target order #19.
Note: To avoid duplication, the option requires current target store data deletion.

= Can my new hosting cause migration interruption? =
In case your store has a big number of entities, please make sure your hosting plan has enough space to accommodate all the data. Otherwise, Cart2Cart won’t be able to transfer your entities and migration will be interrupted.

= Does migration influence the speed of my store? =
The migration process doesn’t influence the speed of your store performance. Needless, to say a newly established store without data will work faster than a store with thousands of products, orders and customers. The most common reasons that may cause a slowdown of your store are:
amount of products doesn’t meet a memory limit of your hosting plan; wide range of third-party modules; numerous product variants, product images; viruses; resource consuming template with animations; large amount of visitors.

= Do you migrate the customer passwords? =
"I would like to migrate from one shopping cart to another with encrypted customer passwords. Is there a way for customers to preserve the accounts but be prompted to enter new passwords? "
Customer accounts can be migrated from source to target shopping cart. Cart2Cart doesn't migrate the passwords, because they are encrypted specifically.
Your clients should use Password Recovery tool on your target shopping cart to access their accounts. However, order history will be available after the migration.
You can find more detailed information about password recovery in our article.
*Note: Please, check if migration of corresponding types of data is supported for your shopping cart.
